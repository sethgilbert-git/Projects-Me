# You are the Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. Your job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. You will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.

hairstyles = ["bouffant", "pixie", "dreadlocks", "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]

prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]

last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2]
# Task #1: Carly wants to be able to market her low prices. We want to find out what the average price of a cut is. First, let’s sum up all the prices of haircuts. Create a variable total_price, and set it to 0
total_price = 0
# Task #2: Loop through the prices list and add each price to the variable total_price.
for price in prices:
  total_price += price
# Task #3: After your loop, create a variable called average_price that is the total_price divided by the number of prices.
average_price = total_price / len(prices)
# Task #4: Print the value of average_price
print("Average Haircut Price: ", average_price)
# Task #5: That average price is more expensive than Carly thought it would be! She wants to cut all prices by 5 dollars.
new_prices = [pricee - 5 for pricee in prices]
# Task #6: Print new_prices
print(new_prices)
# Task #7: Carly really wants to make sure that Carly’s Clippers is a profitable endeavor. She first wants to know how much revenue was brought in last week.
total_revenue = 0
# Task #8: Use a for loop to create a variable i that goes from 0 to len(hairstyles)
for i in hairstyles:
  i = range(len(hairstyles))
# Task #9: Add the product of prices[i] (the price of the haircut at position i) and last_week[i] (the number of people who got the haircut at position i) to total_revenue at each step
for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
  total_revenue += prices[i] * last_week[i]
# Task #10: After your loop, print the value of total_revenue, so the output looks like:

print("Total Revenue: ", total_revenue)
# Task #11: Find the average daily revenue by dividing total_revenue by 7. Call this number average_daily_revenue and print it out.
total_revenue = 0
for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
  total_revenue += prices[i] * last_week[i]
average_daily_revenue = total_revenue / 7
print("Average Daily Revenue: ", average_daily_revenue)
# Task #12: Carly thinks she can bring in more customers by advertising all of the haircuts she has that are under 30 dollars. Use a list comprehension to create a list called cuts_under_30 that has the entry hairstyles[i] for each i for which new_prices[i] is less than 30.
cuts_under_30 = [hairstyles[i] for i in range(len(new_prices)) if new_prices[i] < 30]


print(cuts_under_30)
